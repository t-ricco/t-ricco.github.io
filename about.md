My name is Tom Riccobono, and welcome to my webpage! I'm a data scientist who spent over 17 years as a math educator in the New York City, where I was born and raised. I hope to use this space to share some of my explorations into things that I am passionate about: Music, sports (especially baseball) politics, and public policy. I hope you enjoy what you find here.
